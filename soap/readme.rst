v1.0 SOAP API CRUD Using Codeigniter
###################

This branch constains CRUD (Create,Retrieve,Update and Delete) oparation in SOAP. This has the most simplest code that can be used as base code for SOAP API development and demonstration purpose. I used Nusoap for the SOAP server.


**************************
Changelog and New Features
**************************

v1.0 - Nov. 13, 2016
 - initial release 

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
